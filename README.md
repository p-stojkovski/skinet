Why Async/Await:

So, imagine we had a way of doing things step by step, like following a recipe. Now, instead of waiting for each step to finish before moving on to the next one, we can multitask.

Let's say we're asking someone for information, like checking what's in stock at a store. If we ask and then wait for the answer without doing anything else, it's not very efficient, especially if it takes a while to get the information.

Making things asynchronous is like asking for the info and then doing other things while waiting. So, we're not just standing there doing nothing. Once we get the answer, we go back and continue with what we were doing.

This helps a lot when we have lots of requests coming in. If we didn't do it this way, each request would tie up our system until it gets what it needs, and that's not great for handling many requests at once.

So, making our code asynchronous is like having a more organized and efficient way of handling many tasks at the same time, making things work better, especially when dealing with lots of requests.
